    <P><b>What qualifies as a workout?</b><BR><BR>
        A series of exercises that are planned, organised, and goal-oriented. These goals vary from person to person and range from losing weight to strength building, improving flexibility, or conditioning the cardiovascular system. Not just physiological, workouts have tremendous benefits for our mind and help keep it agile. Workouts are developed for individuals, keeping in mind their age, exercise experience, and fitness levels, and can be classified into beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels. Workouts generally comprise strength, stretching, balance, and aerobic exercises designed to achieve specific objectives.</P>
    <BR><BR><b>What makes morning workouts so special?</b><BR><BR>
        The amazing all-around benefits that we gain from workouts make it even more important to start the day with an early morning home workout. According to ancient yogic science, the pre-dawn time or the ‘Brahma Muhurta’ i.e between 3:30 am to 5:30 am is the time of the creator. It is believed the benefit of studying, praying, and exercising increase during this period. Scientifically also, for your health to be good morning workouts are recommended. When you workout in the morning, you do so on an empty stomach and bowels, which is imperative for exercising. Besides, your mind and body are less stressed and tired. This is the time when there are few distractions and you reap the benefits of exercise all day through improved metabolism and a healthier mindset.
