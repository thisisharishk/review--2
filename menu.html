    <H2>BELIEFS</H2>
       <P> A state of the art gym for fitness lovers with a passion for variety.<BR> After noticing we couldn't find a studio that offered enough to consistently motivate us, we decided to create one! MyFitness Suites is a fitness facility that provides a mix of instructor-led classes for improved strength, endurance, flexibility, and wellness.<BR> Mix and match weight training, boot camp, hot yoga, HIIT, hot barre, pilates, functional fitness, and more.<BR> Our classes cost less than a babysitter and we offer that to our members for free!  
        <BR>Our vision is to create a community of like-minded people who share in the mission of health and wellness for all. We owe it to ourselves and our families to be healthy in mind, body, and spirit. <BR> MyFitness Suites is run by a group of trainers who own and share in this vision. <BR> They are leaders in their communities and the best at their craft. <BR> Come join us for a class and join in the movement.</P>
