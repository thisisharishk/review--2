    <P><B>What should I eat to bulk up fast?</B><br><br>
        Like we said, just because you’re bulking, it’s not an excuse to over-do it on the junk food and double your calorie intake – keep it clean for lean gains. We’re talking good quality sources of protein, such as chicken breasts, fish, eggs, and plain yoghurt — these are rich in essential amino acids, which are needed to build new muscle proteins.
        <br><br>1
        
        The amino acid which is deemed most important for building muscle is leucine — a branched chain amino acid. Leucine is the best stimulator of the metabolic pathway that leads to the production of new muscle proteins — it’s basically the ‘on switch’.<Br>2 It’s recommended that you consume 50 mg per kg of body mass of leucine daily, which can be achieved through your diet (chicken, tuna, and tofu are good options) or a supplement (whey protein has the highest leucine content).<BR>
        
        <br><br>You also need a good amount of carbohydrates to recover properly from your workout. Carbohydrates are mainly stored in the body as muscle glycogen and are the main fuel source used during exercise. After your workout, your muscle glycogen stores need topping back up to make sure you’re ready for the next session — eating carbs is the way to do this.4 Good options include:<br><br>
        
        Whole-wheat pasta,
        Rice,
        Potatoes & sweet potatoes,
        Wholemeal bread,
        Oats,
        Fruit
        Fats are the most energy-dense macronutrient, packing in 9 calories per gram — that’s more than twice that of protein and carbs. So, increasing your fat intake is an easy way to boost your calorie intake and enter a caloric surplus. BUT, this also means it’s easy to go overboard and consume too many calories from fats — so portion control is key. Opt for ‘good fats’ (mono- and poly- unsaturated fats) such as:<br><br>
        
        Nuts & nut butters,
        Seeds,
        Avocado,
        Oils,
        Dairy products,
        Amidst all of this, don’t neglect your micronutrients — vitamins and minerals are essential for overall health, so make sure to eat a variety of fruit and veg in your diet.</P>
