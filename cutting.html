    <P>A cutting diet reduces a person’s calorie intake to lose body fat while maintaining muscle mass. Cutting diets typically prioritize lean proteins, nutrient-dense vegetables, and whole grains.

        Bodybuilders and fitness enthusiasts often use a cutting diet after a bulking phase to achieve a leaner physique.

        A cutting diet, also sometimes referred to as shredding, aims to help someone lose fat and maintain muscle.
        
        Bodybuilders and fitness enthusiasts typically use the cutting diet as a short-term program before an event, competition, or as part of their training plan.
        
        People use a cutting diet in combination with lifting weights. Weightlifting helps them maintain their muscle mass while they cut calories.
        
        
        <BR><BR>How to do a cutting diet <BR><BR>
        Competitive bodybuilders typically follow a cutting diet for 2–4 monthsTrusted Source.
        
        A person can decide the duration of a cutting diet according to their individual needs, but it is not a long-term diet.
        
        Bodybuilders usually go through a bulking phase before a cutting diet.
        
        Bulking allows a high-calorie, protein-rich diet with intense weightlifting to “bulk up” a person and increase muscle mass.
        
        During this phase, it is crucial to consume more calories than the body needs to maintain its weight, to use these excess calories to build new muscle.
        
        Nutrition and fitness professionals call this creating a “caloric surplus.”
        
        Bulking up usually results in a person gaining some weight from fat as well as muscle.
        
        The cutting phase aims to eliminate the fat gained during the bulking phase while retaining as much muscle mass as possible.
        
        <BR><BR>Weight loss and macronutrients<BR><BR>
        To achieve weight loss, a person needs to use more energy than they consume. Nutrition and fitness experts call this creating a “caloric deficit.”
        
        A person should first work out how many calories they need according to their sex, age, and size, then determine their calories per day to lose weight.
        
        During the cutting period, a person’s body mass decreases, and their metabolism adapts. They need to adjust the number of calories they consume to account for this.
        
        Below is a summary of dietary recommendations that people can use in a cutting diet. The suggestions are primarily from a 2014 reviewTrusted Source analyzing preparations for bodybuilding contests.
        
        It is important to note that dietary needs may vary from person to person.
        
        <BR><BR>Weekly weight loss: 0.5 to 1%Trusted Source of body weight.<BR><BR>
        Protein: 2.3–3.1Trusted Source grams per kilogram (kg) of body weight, or 25–30%Trusted Source.
        <BR><BR>Fat: 15Trusted Source–30% of total calories.
            <BR><BR>Carbohydrates: 55–60%Trusted Source of total calories, or the remaining amount of calories after someone has calculated their protein and fat.</P>
